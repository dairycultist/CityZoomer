Simple indie movement shooter demo.

Storm the castle-type gameplay format:

- Two teams of two: Attackers and defenders.
- Attackers need to reach and push out the defenders from their win-zone.
- Defenders need to stay within their win-zone.
- If one team is completely eliminated, the other team wins the round. Otherwise, if the timer reaches zero and at least one defender is within their win-zone, the defenders win the round.

short rounds means gameplay is quick and you're usually doing stuff at the same time and around your teammate

simple character controller with big boobs

fun to play (by myself with bots) (multiplayer is planned tho)

---

- finalize bot positioning + state change behaviour
- add reloading
- add actual dynamic animation
- add bullet holes and a pistol 3D model
- add footstep sounds (probably just the jump sound with a shorter tail?)
- I have the idea of making the map kinda like a warehouse
  (with high up windows, vents with fans, a big garage door like
  on nuke, and have attackers spawn outside in a loading bay),
  I wonder why the defenders would be defending it tho
- round system, including timer, score tracking, and spectating

after all that, u can refactor :3

I like ZZZ's characters (scifi worldbuilding/setting/clothing/boobs)

hire a korean fiverr voice actress to perform a stoic yet endearing line delivery

character customization: placeholder base 3D model with 1) bones 2) shapekeys for body proportion sliders 3) texture compositing (separate face, clothing, and white skin texture for color change) 4) hat anchor

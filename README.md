### Gameplay
- \[DONE] Bhopping.
- \[DONE] Arrow pointing to next checkpoint.
- Infinite level generation (for infinite gamemode).
  - PlacementModules (have an entrance and an exit, and are guaranteed to never intersect with others): City, highway, etc
- Passing a checkpoint moves the checkpoint to its next location.
- Car obstacles (they're hovercars; once reaching the end of a road, they simply follow it down).
- Toggle for autojump.
- Shooting.
- Enemy turret things that pew pew at you.
- Jump pads.
  - Does subtle camera shake like TF2 Pyro jetpack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRC124bQsGI
- Rocket jumping (or handheld spring?).
- If you're in the air for more than a second, an airtime counter will appear like a score counter in a skating game.

### Aesthetics
- Holding a gun.
- Passing a checkpoint does the FOV zoom in then slowly back to normal effect, but subtle (should likely be toggleable).
  - Also makes the music immediately pitch down before slowly going back to normal (same as FOV effect)
- \[DONE] Checkpoints look like they did (big cylinders) but kinda fade out to the top, maybe oscillating like a flame. Also they have particles.
- \[DONE] GUI arrow pointing to the next checkpoint.
- \[DONE] Death barrier has cool glitchy shader.

### Other
- Pause menu with settings.
- Main menu (can look at character? customize stuff? level editor? idk)

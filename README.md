player model has boobs and animations built into the file (textures and IK aren't :\<)

## TODO
- mercenary has hand bones that are used as the "tip"; their basis matches the target so that they properly hold the rifle
- Main menu/bento mode select (additionally: can look at character, customize stuff, level editor, whatever)
- customization menu next to paper doll
- Inventory system with arbitrary items (could spawn on infinite levels to spice up gameplay as you go on, or be cool for multiplayer gamemodes. weapons, movement tech, etc)
- Toggle for autojump in pause settings.
- Shooting.

- Enemy turret things that pew pew at you.
- Movement tech.
  - Median bouncing.
  - Jump pads (does subtle camera shake like TF2 Pyro jetpack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRC124bQsGI).
  - Rocket jumping? Handheld spring? Contact-grenade launcher?
- If you're in the air for more than a second, an airtime counter will appear like a score counter in a skating game.

- Passing a checkpoint does the FOV zoom in then slowly back to normal effect, but subtle (should likely be toggleable).
  - Also makes the music immediately pitch down before slowly going back to normal (same as FOV effect)

# CityZoomer

### Gameplay
- Once out of starting area, there's no standing still - you're always moving forward. As you pass checkpoints, the speed you move forward increases.
- Either auto-jump (so the only thing you need to worry about is steering, remember air control), or manual jump (if you don't jump on time, you crash into the ground and lose).
- Arrow pointing to next checkpoint.
- Level generation.

### Aesthetics
- Passing a checkpoint does the FOV zoom in then slowly back to normal effect, but subtle (should likely be toggleable).
  - Also makes the music immediately pitch down before slowly going back to normal (same as FOV effect)
- Checkpoints look like they did (big cylinders) but kinda fade out to the top, maybe oscillating like a flame.

### Other
- Pause menu with settings.
- Main menu (can look at character? customize stuff? level editor? idk)

I like ZZZ's characters (scifi worldbuilding/setting/clothing/boobs)

simple indie bhop hack and slash adventure rpg roguelike

you spawn in a level, defeat waves of enemies, then two portals drop and you choose which next level to go to

3D model a cat robot girl and hire a korean fiverr voice actress to perform a stoic yet endearing line delivery

"let's bounce!"

# CityZoomer

Rougelike FPS with tight movement, and bhopping, gunplay, and boobs. the end goal to be a "save the princess" type deal, but the princess is stacked, so the goal is really to touch the maiden's boobs

on scene load, a full level is randomly generated. it's mostly linear with a few short off-shoots

should probably rename since this is no longer a port of cz lol

[similar game idea but I won't steal dwdw](https://ln404.itch.io/force-reboot), I should also reference Dusk since I liked that game, the movement and gunplay and enemies were very solid

think about cool graphics later I want GAMEPLAY

## TODO
- model floating arm and boob models (the latter you only see when looking down)
	- ensure arm has hand bones (they should be used as the "tip" for IK; their basis matches the target so that they properly hold the rifle)
 	- player model has boobs and animations built into the file (textures and IK aren't :\<)
- I want a super smash bros brawl style menu with a paper doll of the player
- Inventory system with arbitrary items (including using those items, e.g. shooting)
	- Rocket jumping? Handheld spring? Contact-grenade launcher?
- Toggle for bhop autojump in pause settings

I like ZZZ's characters (scifi worldbuilding/setting/clothing/boobs)

simple indie bhop hack and slash adventure rpg roguelike

you spawn in a level, defeat waves of enemies, then two portals drop and you choose which next level to go to

3D model a cat robot girl and hire a korean fiverr voice actress to perform a stoic yet endearing line delivery

"let's bounce!"

when you get within attack range of an enemy, a small white circle will appear on them letting you know you can hit them. if you press space near the bottom of your jump, you will attack them.

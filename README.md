# CityZoomer

should probably rename since this is no longer a port of cz lol

boob based rougelike first person shooter with tight movement and bhop

on scene load, a full level is randomly generated. it's mostly linear with a few short off-shoots

like this game lol https://ln404.itch.io/force-reboot

player model has boobs and animations built into the file (textures and IK aren't :\<)

think about cool graphics later I want GAMEPLAY

## TODO
- add hand bones to player that are used as the "tip"; their basis matches the target so that they properly hold the rifle
- I want a super smash bros brawl style menu with a paper doll of the player
- Inventory system with arbitrary items (including using those items, e.g. shooting)
	- Rocket jumping? Handheld spring? Contact-grenade launcher?
- Toggle for bhop autojump in pause settings

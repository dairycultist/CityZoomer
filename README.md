# CityZoomer

Simple indie movement shooter demo.

Storm the castle-type gameplay format:

- Two teams of two: Attackers and defenders.
- Attackers need to reach and push out the defenders from their win-zone.
- Defenders need to stay within their win-zone.
- If one team is completely eliminated, the other team wins the round. Otherwise, if the timer reaches zero and at least one defender is within their win-zone, the defenders win the round.

short rounds means gameplay is quick and you're usually doing stuff at the same time and around your teammate

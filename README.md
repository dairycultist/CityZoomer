# CityZoomer

Rougelike first-person extraction shooter with tight movement, and bhopping, gunplay, and boobs.

brutalist architecture á la soviet union for the style (I like it + easy to model + worldbuilding/setting + gasmasks)

hallway with barebones dormitory rooms since the workers of the facility need to sleep somewhere, and it can also make for cool worldbuilding like the place is an actual lived-in place

SCP but there's only one anomaly and it's busty anomolous extradimensional demongirls that appear from who knows where and are locked up and studied, but there's a Chaos Insurgency (name pending) hell-bent on letting 'em loose

maybe you can also "gain favour" with demongirls during your run, which act as permanant upgrades across runs

gameplay loop: enter a level, quickly get money, extract (before enemies get too powerful), visit the shop, upgrade, repeat

should probably rename since this is no longer a port of cz lol

[similar game idea but I won't steal dwdw](https://ln404.itch.io/force-reboot), I should also reference Dusk since I liked that game, the movement and gunplay and enemies were very solid

think about cool graphics later I want GAMEPLAY

## TODO
- I want a super smash bros brawl style menu with a paper doll of the player
- neat levels. remember the game doesn't really have to be high fidelity, just add neat stuff
- Toggle for bhop autojump in pause settings

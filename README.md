### Gameplay
- \[DONE] Bhopping.
- \[DONE] Arrow pointing to next checkpoint.
- Infinite level generation (for infinite gamemode).
- Passing a checkpoint moves the checkpoint to its next location.
- Car obstacles (they're hovercars; once reaching the end of a road, they simply follow it down).
- Main menu/mode select (additionally: can look at character, customize stuff, level editor, whatever)
- Pause menu with settings.
  - Toggle for autojump.
- Shooting.
- Enemy turret things that pew pew at you.
- Movement tech.
  - Median bouncing.
  - Jump pads (does subtle camera shake like TF2 Pyro jetpack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRC124bQsGI).
  - Rocket jumping? Handheld spring? Contact-grenade launcher?
- If you're in the air for more than a second, an airtime counter will appear like a score counter in a skating game.

- Inventory with arbitrary items (could spawn on infinite levels to spice up gameplay as you go on, or be cool for multiplayer gamemodes. weapons, movement tech, etc)

### Aesthetics
- Holding a gun.
- Legs.
- Passing a checkpoint does the FOV zoom in then slowly back to normal effect, but subtle (should likely be toggleable).
  - Also makes the music immediately pitch down before slowly going back to normal (same as FOV effect)
- \[DONE] Checkpoints look like they did (big cylinders) but kinda fade out to the top, maybe oscillating like a flame. Also they have particles.
- \[DONE] GUI arrow pointing to the next checkpoint.
- \[DONE] Death barrier has cool glitchy shader.

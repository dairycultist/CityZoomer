# CityZoomer

### Gameplay:
- Once out of starting area, there's no standing still - you're always moving forward. As you pass checkpoints, the speed you move forward increases.
- Either auto-jump (so the only thing you need to worry about is steering, remember air control), or manual jump (if you don't jump on time, you crash into the ground and lose).
- Passing a checkpoint does the FOV zoom in then slowly back to normal effect, but subtle (should likely be toggleable).
- Arrow pointing to next checkpoint.
- Level generation.

### Other:
- Pause menu with settings.
- Main menu (can look at character? customize stuff? level editor? idk)

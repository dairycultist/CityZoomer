# CityZoomer

I like ZZZ's characters (scifi worldbuilding/setting/clothing/boobs)

sandbox bhop sim

reaching bhop milestones could unlock stuff ig

think about cool graphics later I want GAMEPLAY

## TODO
- I want a super smash bros brawl style menu with a paper doll of the player
- neat levels/level select (e.g. rectangle UI with text Japan City and image of map). remember the game doesn't really have to be high fidelity, just add neat stuff
- Toggle for bhop autojump in pause settings

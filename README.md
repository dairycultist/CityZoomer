I like ZZZ's characters (scifi worldbuilding/setting/clothing/boobs)

simple indie bhop hack and slash adventure rpg roguelike

you spawn in a level, defeat waves of enemies, then two portals drop and you choose which next level to go to

3D model a cat robot girl and hire a korean fiverr voice actress to perform a stoic yet endearing line delivery

"let's bounce!"

when you get within attack range of an enemy, a small white circle will appear on them letting you know you can hit them. if you press space near the bottom of your jump, you will attack them.
doing this multiple jumps in a row earns a combo. if you go a jump without attacking, your combo ends and points are scored. if you attack without being near the bottom of your jump or when there are no enemies to attack, your combo fails and no points are scored.
